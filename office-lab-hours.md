These are the dedicated times I’ll be available for questions, collaboration, and project support.  
Feel free to drop by during these windows if you need help with setup, coding, or understanding concepts.

## Notes
- Office hours are flexible — if you can’t make it, reach out to schedule a 1:1.  
- Sessions can be used for debugging, walkthroughs, or brainstorming.  
- Please come prepared with specific questions or code snippets to make the most of the time.
